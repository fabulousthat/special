## Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)Mohini,
Check this when you are free.

This is something personal and meant only for you. 

I'd appreciate it if you could keep it between us for now.

I've created a thing for you. Please check it out [here](https://fabulousthat.github.io/special/fabulous.html).

Also to mention if you get lost in some wrong direction, you may just refresh the page.

Dont worry, The only thing that matters is the last link you click or send. <-----(If this line sounds confusing, then you must visit the link first)

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Thanking you.
